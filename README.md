Python-Much-Difficult
=====================
Exercises from the book "Learn Python The Hard Way".

I still have no idea how github works the way it does. 
I figured uploading my excercises to github would be a good way to become more familiar with both (Python & Github)
If you have any constructive feedback let me know.
